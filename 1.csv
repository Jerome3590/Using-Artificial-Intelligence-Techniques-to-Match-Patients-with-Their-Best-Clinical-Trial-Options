"1","Randomized Phase II Selection Study of Ramucirumab and Paclitaxel versus FOLFIRI in Refractory Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma","This phase II trial studies how well ramucirumab and paclitaxel or the FOLFIRI regimen (leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride) work in treating patients with small bowel cancers that have spread extensively to other anatomic sites (advanced) or are no longer responding to treatment (refractory). Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody that attaches to and inhibits a molecule called VEGFR-2. This may restrain new blood vessel formation therefore reducing nutrient supply to tumor which may interfere with tumor cell growth and expansion. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel or FOLFIRI, may be helpful in treating advanced or refractory small bowel cancers and may help patients live longer.","20"
"2","A Phase 3, Interventional, Randomized, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of DCC-2618 vs Sunitinib in Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors After Treatment With Imatinib","This is a 2-arm, randomized, open-label, international, multicenter study comparing the efficacy of DCC-2618 to sunitinib in GIST patients who progressed on or were intolerant to first-line anticancer treatment with imatinib. Approximately 426 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to DCC-2618 150 mg once daily (QD) (continuous dosing for 6 week cycles) or sunitinib 50 mg QD (6 week cycles, 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off).","20"
"3","A Phase III Multicenter, Open Label Randomized Controlled Trial of Cefoxitin versus Piperacillin-Tazobactam as Surgical Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Patients Undergoing Pancreatoduodenectomy","This randomized phase III trial studies cefoxitin compared with piperacillin-tazobactam in preventing surgical site infections in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy. Antibiotics, such as cefoxitin and piperacillin-tazobactam, may prevent or control infections in patients undergoing surgery. Giving cefoxitin or piperacillin-tazobactam to find out which antibiotic is better may help patients avoid surgical site infections after their pancreatoduodenectomy, avoid delays in recovery, and minimize extra burdens placed on patients, their families and caregivers.","20"
"4","Phase II Evaluation of the Effect of 2 versus 6 Hour Oxaliplatin Infusions on Neuropathy and Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Gastrointestinal Cancers","This phase II trial studies how well giving oxaliplatin over 6 hours works in preventing nerve damage in patients with gastrointestinal cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Oxaliplatin can cause side effects such as nerve damage that may delay or reduce the dose of oxaliplatin. Giving oxaliplatin over a longer period of time (6 hours) may prevent or delay the development of nerve damage, which may keep patients on standard doses of chemotherapy longer, without having to delay treatment.","20"
"5","Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-Label, First-in-Human Study of DS-6157a in Subjects With Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor","This study will assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of DS-6157a in participants with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).","20"
"6","A Phase 2 Multi-Center, Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Assess the Clinical and Antiviral Efficacy and Safety of Nitazoxanide for the Treatment of Norovirus in Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Solid Organ Transplant Recipients","This is a phase 2 multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide for the treatment of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with symptomatic diarrhea due to Norovirus. The study involves a total of 160 Hematopoietic Stem Cell or Solid Organ transplant recipients, equal to or greater than 12 years of age with diagnosis of Norovirus who will be selected and randomly assigned (1:1) to nitazoxanide or placebo group. The study duration is 60 months and subject participation duration is 6 months. Given the safety of prolonged therapy with nitazoxanide, lack of interactions with common post-transplant medications, putative antiviral activity and prolonged duration of viral shedding we are assessing 56 doses of therapy. The longitudinal monitoring phase will provide useful information on the course of host and viral responses in subjects with chronic Norovirus infection with and without treatment. Randomization will be stratified by age group (pediatric (12 through 17 years) vs. adult (greater than or equal to 18 years)), chronicity of Norovirus-associated symptoms (acute (less than 14 days) vs. chronic (greater than or equal to 14 days)) and transplant type (solid organ (SOT)) vs. hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)). Enrolled subjects will participate in 2 phases of the study: Treatment Phase, which will include dosing with the assigned study agent for 28 days. Longitudinal Monitoring Phase which will include telephone call on Days 35, 53, 113, 173. Primary objective is 1) to assess the clinical efficacy of nitazoxanide for the management of acute and chronic Norovirus in transplant recipients.","20"
"7","A Phase Ib / II Study of MEK162 in Combination with Imatinib Mesylate in Patients with Untreated Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)","This phase Ib / II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of binimetinib when given together with imatinib mesylate and to see how well they work in treating patients with untreated gastrointestinal stromal tumors that have spread from where they started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or to other places in the body (advanced). Binimetinib and imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.","20"
"8","A Phase 3, INterVentional, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of DCC-2618 In Patients With AdvanCed Gastrointestinal Stromal TUmorS Who Have Received Treatment With Prior Anticancer Therapies","This is a 2-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, international, multicenter study comparing the efficacy of DCC-2618 to placebo in patients who have received treatment with prior anticancer therapies. Prior anticancer therapies must include imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib (3 prior therapies). Approximately 120 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to DCC-2618 150 mg QD or placebo","20"
"9","A Multicenter Phase II Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Patients with Advanced Small Bowel Adenocarcinomas","This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.","20"
"10","A Feasibility and Registration Study of Proton Radiotherapy for Upper Gastrointestinal and Biliary Malignancies","This early phase I trial studies proton beam radiation therapy and fluorouracil or capecitabine in treating patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer. Specialized radiation therapy, such as proton beam radiation therapy, that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving proton beam radiation therapy together with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.","20"
